# first page

- this is my first time to setup a site with github pages,url:http://hikarulim.github.io/jekyll_demo/
- and i don't know how this works,just followed some articles step by step.
- and this happened 3 years ago
- it seems not so hard to setup a site with github pages when i see https://pages.github.com/ just now
- no branch changing(like `gh-pages`),no other confused things.

---

- and the second step to host a theme,now i want to use Hugo,not jekyll any longer.
